This is a simple/naive implementation of javascript in scala
The reason for this project is to thoroughly learn javascript,
and at the same time practice making interpreters using
combinator parsing in scala.

This project aims at implementing the full ECMA 262 standard, but most likely
won't do it. The degree of completion remains to be seen. As the aim of this
project is to learn, and not to provide the world with yet another javascript
runtime, the project will end when there's no worthwhile challenges left.

Current incompatibilities:
 - no automatic semicolon insertion
 - semicolons are used as separators between statements, and not terminators
 - a \n ++ b will be interpreted as (a++)\n b, instead of a \n (++b)
 - labels needs to be preceeded by @label
 - comments are not supported
 - currently transforms assignments like 'a += x' into 'a = a + x'. This is
   performed before the evaluation of a, meaning that a.e. 'a[i++] += 1' is
   transformed into 'a[i++] = a[i++] + 1', which is clearly wrong. This is
   done just to get onwards with the implementation, and will be fixed once
   the actual runtime implementation is in place
