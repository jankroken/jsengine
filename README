This is a simple/naive implementation of javascript in scala
The reason for this project is to thoroughly learn javascript,
and at the same time practice making interpreters using
combinator parsing in scala.

THis project may and may not implement the full ECMA 262 standard,
and may or may not violate it in key areas...

(oh, and may or may not be completed :)
