This is a simple/naive implementation of javascript in scala
The reason for this project is to thoroughly learn javascript,
and at the same time practice making interpreters using
combinator parsing in scala.

THis project may and may not implement the full ECMA 262 standard,
and may or may not violate it in key areas...

(oh, and may or may not be completed :)

Current incompatibilities:
   no automatic semicolon insertion
   semicolons are used as separators between statements, and not terminators
   a \n ++ b will be interpreted as (a++)\n b, instead of a \n (++b)
   labeles needs to be preceeded by @label
   comments are not supported
